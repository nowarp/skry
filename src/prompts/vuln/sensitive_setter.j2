{% if struct_sources %}
## SHARED STRUCT DEFINITIONS
These are shared objects - globally accessible, need authorization for modification:
{% for type_name, struct_src in struct_sources.items() %}
```move
{{ struct_src }}
```
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## FUNCTION ({{ visibility }}): {{ func_name }}
{% if entry_docstring %}
{{ entry_docstring }}
{% endif %}
```move
{{ entry_source }}
```

{% if callee_sources %}
## CALLEES (receive mutable shared object):
{% for callee, callee_source in callee_sources.items() %}
### {{ callee }}
```move
{{ callee_source }}
```
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## TASK
Analyze if this function is a SENSITIVE SETTER that should require admin authorization.

This function takes &mut to a shared object and has NO capability/role parameter.

FIRST, check for ACCESS CONTROL mechanisms:
- Does the function verify caller identity before modifying state?
- Look for: assert!/abort conditions comparing tx_context::sender() against stored addresses
- Look for: any conditional checks that gate execution based on caller identity
- If ANY access control mechanism exists, the function is SAFE (has_access_control=true)

IF NO ACCESS CONTROL, then classify:

VULNERABLE (needs admin auth):
- Modifies protocol-wide configuration (fee rates, interest rates, parameters)
- Changes admin/owner addresses or roles
- Updates protocol limits, caps, thresholds, or multipliers
- Modifies pause/lock/freeze states
- Changes oracle/price feed settings
- Any state change that affects ALL users or protocol economics

SAFE (no admin auth needed):
- User modifies their OWN data/position (user-scoped state)
- User deposits/withdraws their OWN assets
- Initializes user's personal record
- View/getter function
- Creates new user-owned objects
