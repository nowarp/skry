## TASK
Analyze this Move function for arbitrary recipient drain vulnerability.

Context: This function transfers value to a user-controlled address without role-based auth.

Determine if this is ACTUALLY VULNERABLE or a FALSE POSITIVE:

VULNERABLE (real drain): Attacker can steal funds that belong to OTHER users or the protocol.
- Example: transfer(pool.balance, attacker_address) - drains shared pool to arbitrary recipient
- Admin extracts user funds to arbitrary address (not the asset owner)

FALSE POSITIVE (safe patterns):
- User withdraws/unwraps their OWN funds to chosen address (burn from sender, then transfer)
- User transfers their OWN assets/coins to another address they control
- The transferred value comes FROM the caller (ctx.sender), not from shared state
- Admin returns funds to the ORIGINAL OWNER (e.g., transfer(coins, vault.owner) where vault belongs to that owner)
- Emergency withdrawal that sends assets back to their rightful owner field

Key questions:
1. Can the caller only transfer value they themselves own/deposited?
2. If this is admin-gated, does it transfer funds back to the original asset owner (check for owner/user fields)?
